- the difference between internal and external linkage using examples from your code
Internal linkage is used for the variables' scope that is itself's module, such as static variable. 
External linkage is used for extern variable.

- what are `static` variables and how were they useful in this workshop.
`static` variables's life time is the same as the application,but the scope of it is on in its module.
